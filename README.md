## Elixir sandbox

**You must have `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed**

After that, run `docker-compose up -d`, and then log into it's bash: `docker-compose run elixir bash`
In docker bash you can type `iex` for interactive elixir console, or `iex -S mix` to compile sample code and run the console with that code available in it.
